## Research

* Using BMR (Basal Metabloic Rate) to calculate Calorie intake
> Women:

10-17 years 
BMR: 13.4 x weight + 692

18-29 years 
BMR: 14.8 x weight + 487

30-59 years 
BMR: 8.3 x weight + 846

So if you are a 26-year-old woman who weighs 63kgs your BMR is 1,419.4 calories per day.

Men:

10-17 years 
BMR: 17.7 x weight + 657

18-29 years 
BMR: 15.1 x weight + 692

30-59 years 
BMR: 11.5 x weight + 873
